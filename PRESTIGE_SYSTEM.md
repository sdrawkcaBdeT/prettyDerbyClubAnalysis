The "Road to Legend" Club Prestige System
1. System Overview

The "Road to Legend" is a permanent progression system designed for the "Cash Crew Fans" club to reward members for both their in-game performance (Fan Gain) and their loyalty (Tenure). Members earn Prestige Points daily, which accumulate over time to unlock a series of 12 permanent, themed ranks within the Discord server.

The system is designed to be:

    Engaging: With a long and rewarding progression path.

    Clear: Using a simple "100-point" daily benchmark for solid performance.

    Thematic: Based on the real-world progression of horse racing awards, from medals to legendary trophies.

2. The Prestige Formula: "Core Contributor"

The daily prestige calculation is anchored to a benchmark where a member on pace for 20 million fans per month earns approximately 100 points per day.

    Performance Points: 1 Prestige Point for every 8,333 fans gained in the last 24 hours.

    Tenure Points: A flat 20 Prestige Points awarded to every active member, every day.

Example Calculation:
A member who gains 667,000 fans in a day earns:

    667,000 / 8,333 = 80.0 Performance Points

    20 Tenure Points

    Total: 100 Prestige Points

4. Data & Automation Flow

The system operates on a simple, daily data pipeline:

    Data Collection: The existing club data script runs, collecting the latest fan counts and creating an up-to-date fan_log.csv.

    Prestige Calculation: The prestige_calculator.py script is run once per day. It reads fan_log.csv, calculates the daily fan gain for every member, applies the prestige formula, and updates the master prestige_data.csv file with the new totals.

    Discord Bot Automation: The bot.py reads the updated prestige_data.csv.

        Commands: When a user runs /rank or /leaderboard, the bot reads the CSV to provide real-time information.

        Daily Role Update: Once per day, a scheduled task in the bot iterates through all server members, checks their total points from the CSV, and automatically assigns the correct Discord role, removing any old ones.

5. Bot Commands

    /rank: Checks your own (or another member's) current rank, total prestige points, and progress to the next rank.

    /week: Shows your total prestige points earned over the last 7 days.

    /leaderboard: Displays the top 10 members by total prestige points.
